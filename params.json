Import the lib project into your workspace and add it as a library project\r\n2. Look into the library project manifest and copy the definitions\r\n3. Define a Class extending application and init the Authorization class\r\n\r\n\r\n## Calling requests (From the demo project)\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    //----------------------------------\r\n    \r\n    TwitterService.getUsersTwitterRequest(getApplicationContext(), \"android\", new HttpCallbackImplementation())\r\n        .executeAsync();\r\n    \r\n    //----------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n    // Callback returning your defined type\r\n\r\n    private final class HttpCallbackImplementation implements HttpCallback<UserModel> {\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onSuccess(UserModel responseData) {\r\n            textViewResponse.setText(responseData.toString());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onHttpError(ResponseStatus responseCode) {\r\n            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(),\r\n                    responseCode.getStatusCode() + \" \" + responseCode.getStatusMessage(),\r\n                    Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nTwo callback methods are created each executing by default in the Android UI Thread so you don't have to implement the logic for switching back to UI from another thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"Android-rest-client","google":""}
